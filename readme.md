# CTEC3905 Front-end website using HTML, CSS & Javascript.
I have created a photography website called Serenic. I made Serenic mobile-responsive through inspecting the page on a mobile device and creating my media queries to fit the size of the mobile screens.

The website has four pages:
* Home
* Gallery
* About
* Contact Me

The website has been created and styled using HTML and CSS. Javascript has been used to make the website functional and interactive.

## Home page
The home page contains a video background, which was created using four videos that are played on a muted loop. With javascript, there are 4 buttons which can be clicked on to change to the next video.
There is a transition effect which makes the switch from video to video smooth.
There is also a heading and a button, which have been created with HTML and CSS. The button redirects the user to the gallery page.
When the logo is selected on the other pages, it redirects the user to the home page. The navigation bar is fully functional with the use of javascript, it allows the user to view the navbar on a mobile device in a smaller size.

## Gallery page
The gallery page is a filterable photo gallery, containing four categories:
* All Photos
* Sea
* Sky  
* Northern Lights

The javascript allows for the user to select any category, which filters each category specific to its name.
For instance: selecting the sea category will only display photos of the sea.

## About page
Using HTML and CSS, the about page contains an image, headings, and paragraphs.

## Contact page
Using HTML and CSS, the contact page has a heading, paragraphs, a contact form (first & last name, email address, phone number, message), contact links, and an image.

I have used these references to help build my website.
